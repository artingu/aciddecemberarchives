<h1>ACID DECEMBER</h1>
<h3>
Hi Jennyrave! You have contributed a lot this year, but also for some previous years can you describe your music project a bit?
</h3>
<p>
Thank you! Originally, I just wanted to make simple techno. But then I started asking myself, ‘How can I make it sound more like what I was hearing on records?’ That question led me to internet chatrooms, and eventually, I found myself in the Buzz community on IRC.


Most of the time, when I asked how to achieve a specific sound, the answer was, ‘You can’t really do that... but I can show you how to make breakcore, drum and bass, jazz, rock, demo music (tracker music), and other genres I normally wouldn’t try to make.’
Looking back now, I realize a lot of them were just trolls. They could’ve been more upfront with their advice: ‘Learn to make music first, then focus on achieving a specific sound.’ But in their own roundabout way, they still pushed me to explore other genres. It was a chaotic but valuable learning experience that shaped how I approach music today.

By the way, I was also in the original 1st. Acid December, but I guess my song got lost.

These days, I often incorporate techniques meant for one genre into another.

Jeskola Buzz! You crazy person :D Can you tell us a bit about your tools and process? Any tips for other users?
</h3>
<p>
Jeskola Buzz, right? It’s a bit of a wild ride! I love how it gives me so much flexibility and control, even though it can be a bit chaotic at times. My process usually starts with a sound I want to experiment with—whether it’s a certain rhythm, texture, or melody. From there, I dive into Buzz, where I can layer sounds, tweak parameters, and get into the nitty-gritty of what makes each sound unique.

As for tips—don’t be afraid to break the rules, but before you break the rules, you should know the rules! Don’t be that one guy who is proud that he knows nothing about music theory. Also, learn the dark art of sound engineering and learn marketing—these skills are often overlooked but are crucial to your success in music production.

'You crazy person!' It's funny that you’d say that. Most of the Buzz community thinks I’m mentally ill because I’m always talking about quantum physics and theoretical physics.

Your profile on buzztunes says Chicago, aka the birthplace of acid house music! What's the story? What's the scene like today?
</h3>
<p>
Ah, Chicago—definitely a place with a deep connection to electronic music. Acid house really found its roots here, and it’s hard to ignore how influential the city was in shaping the genre. For me, the story goes way back. Growing up around that sound, I was exposed to underground techno and house music. There was always a raw energy to it.

Chicago used to be called the music capital of the world, but they’ve long lost that title. I have a lot of legendary house music producers I would call friends—big superstars in the world—but in Chicago, they’re just regular people. As for the scene today, it’s still thriving, but in a different way. You’ll find a mix of old-school vibes with new elements being brought in by a new generation of producers and DJs. The scene has definitely evolved, with more diversity in terms of genres and sounds, but that core energy is still there. There are plenty of underground parties, DIY venues, and events happening. Chicago’s always been a place for the bold and the experimental, and that’s not changing anytime soon.

What inspires you to make music? Any particular artists you want to give a shoutout to?
</h3>
<p>
What inspires me to make music? Well, it's not really about wanting to make music in the traditional sense. It's more about the desire to learn the craft, especially the dark art of sound engineering. It's about becoming someone who understands the intricacies of sound, how to shape it, manipulate it, and make it come alive. Music for me is a process of continuous learning and growth—it's a way to dive deeper into the technical side of things, while also exploring new ways to express myself through sound.

I can’t name any particular artist because the list would be pages and pages long. But I definitely love the whole tracker/demo scene—it’s a world full of creativity and passion. There are countless producers and creators I admire in that space. That being said, there are a few people I could do without, but you know who you are.
