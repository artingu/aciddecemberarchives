		<p><span>
		In the 1950s, British engineers were faced with a unique problem. In order for the remote detonated atomic landmine they were developing to function in cold weather, they needed a long term heating solution. One of the more creative solutions proposed was to fill the mine with live chickens and chicken feed. The chickens would be able to sustain a natural, comfortably warm temperature enclosed inside the mine together with the payload and detonation mechanism. That way, the landmine could reliably detonate in any weather and save Germany from Germany in the event of a German-German invasion.
		</span></p>
		<p><span>
			It was only in the 2000s that we saw a comeback of this level of creative energy, when scientists discovered that in order to make the month of December bearable, they could prescribe a daily dose of <span class="wobbling">ACID</span> to the entire population. After years of study and placebo trials, <span class="wobbling">ACID DECEMBER</span> was born, unlike the atomic landmine before it.
		</span></p>

		<p><span>
			This year is special, not only because it's the anniversary of the same date one year earlier, but because <span class="wobbling">PARTYING HAS BEEN CANCELED</span>. Droves of dance-deprived <span class="wobbling">ACID BANDITS</span> and masked <span class="wobbling">ACID HIGHWAYMEN</span> roam the internet, looking for their next fix. Help us help them by submitting your <span class="wobbling">OGG or MP3 encoded tracks</span> to <span class="wobbling">linde.philip@gmail.com</span>. We need at least <span class="wobbling">31 tracks</span> to win this, but December has been known to last longer if more tracks are submitted.
		</span></p>

		<p><span>
			<span class="wobbling">DATAPOP.SE</span> has archived some of previous years' <span class="wobbling">ACID DECEMBER</span> <a href="https://acid.datapop.se/">here</a>. We really appreciate it. This has been going on for nearly ten years! Some years are still missing from the archives due to time portals and occurring in alternate histories, but we're working on joining the timelines and undoing the <span class="wobbling">TEMPORAL VANDALISM</span>.

			<p>First out is Valdo's <span class="wobbling">ACID CRUSH!</span> Word on the street is that the name refers to what happens to you if you try to crawl into a space as tight as this mix. Winter is all about crawling up into a ball and getting crushed, so we naturally and unnaturally approve.</p>

			<p>Another day, another acid. Kotten supposedly devised a mathematical theory that was best explained using this track. It proves <span class="wobbling">¬WALTZ</span>, something long suspected by experts in the field, but until now the proof has always been three steps ahead.</p>

We can not stress enough the importance of either doing drugs or not depending on your preference. Jazzdoktorn has constructed an <span class="wobbling">AUDIBLE SIGNAL</span> which will effectively program this message into any mind that is exposed to it.</p>

			<p>We found a jar of <span class="wobbling">IMPRESSIONIST ACID</span> on our doorstep today, and the name "readyletsgo" crudely spray painted on the door.

			<p>We took a <span class="wobbling">MUCH NEEDED WALK</span> and found Surpiotr under a bridge, hunched over a small machine. Watching and listening from a safe distance, we could see that the sound emanating from the machine would react to small adjustments that Surpiotr seemed to consider in great detail...a knob turned here, a button pressed there. We recorded the session in secrecy.</p>

			<p>The working theory: looking for batteries, Kotten instead found this track lodged between the sofa cushions. How a track this <span class="wobbling">W I D E</span> could possibly fit in there, and how it had not melted through the sofa and all the apartments below (leaving holes on each floor like in <span class="wobbling">ALIEN</span>) is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

			<p>Underwater Resistance has been operating from under the sea for the last few centuries, enjoying the <span class="wobbling">SUPERIOR</span> sound propagation properties of water. One time, while near the surface, they saw the northern lights through their squid-like eyes, refracted by the waves above.
