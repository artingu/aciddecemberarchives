<h2>Tracking</h2>
<p>In future historybooks we are going to be looking at this era of the internet they way we look at the early days of industrialism, when robber barons exploited work force and natural resources for their own gains, only whats happening between you and your cellphone every day is much much worse. We can't change that, but on this page you the viewer is not a commodity. We host on the Google Cloud and in their terms of service it is stated that meta data from Cloud consumtions is not used in their regular data collecting. Even so it's safe to assume a lot of people are keeping track, but not us.</p>
